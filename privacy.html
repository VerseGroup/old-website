            We use this information to provide you with the best possible experience. "SchoolVerse" does not collect
            any payment information or payment-related information from users. <br> <br>

            If you link your school account credentials we are able to access your school's student information system 
            (of course only data given with the permission of of the school). For more information on how your school
            collects your data and permissions your school has given "SchoolVerse" or "VerseGroup", please contact your school
            or a member of the "VerseGroup" team (contact information below). Therefore, only approved schools can use "SchoolVerse" products. <br> <br>
            
            This data from your school includes but is not limited to (given data is at the sole discretion of your school): <br> 
            - Student names <br>
            - Student email addresses <br>
            - Student grades <br>
            - Student classes <br>

            <br>

            The "SchoolVerse" software will not read your school data without your explicit permission given by linking your account to the software. "SchoolVerse" does not collect any "sensitive" information such as grades, transcripts, academic records or school reports even if given. 
            "SchoolVerse" does not collect any information about your physical location. <br> <br>

            We soley use this collected information to provide you with our "SchoolVerse" products and services. If reason occurs (such as a bug
            or a help request), the "VerseGroup" team may view your <em>"non-sensitive"</em> data with the sole purposes of continuing to provide
            the best possible experience and assist you in fixing the error. "VerseGroup" <em> cannot</em> (end-to-end encryption) and will not view your 
            "senstive" data (school account username and passwords). <br> <br>

            Current schools that use "SchoolVerse" include but is not limited to: <br>
            - Hackley School (Hackley school administration authorized "VerseGroup" and "SchoolVerse" to read your school data with the sole purpose of providing you this software). <br> <br> 

            Security Information: <br>
            Your "sensitive" data is end-to-end encrypted, split across both your client device and our servers so that access to both your device and our servers is required. This means that even the "VerseGroup" development team does not have access to 
            and cannot view your "sensitive" data (as someone would require both the client device, say your phone, and our server's database, a "Google" database, in order decrypt your information). 
            Your "non-sensitive" data is secured in a "Google Firebase" database. 

            Deleting your data: <br>
            Signing out of "SchoolVerse" automatically deletes all of your "sensitive" data from your device, and therefore permanently unlinks your school account from 
            "SchoolVerse" until you relink them. Deleting your "VerseGroup"/"SchoolVerse" account can be done by contacting a member of the "VerseGroup" team
            below, and this will delete all traces of your user data from our servers. <br> <br>
            
            Other Information: <br>
            "SchoolVerse" does not use any third-party software or services to collect analytics on users.
            "SchoolVerse" does collect "non-sensitive" app usage information (such as number of function executions by user, 
            grades of users, etc.) in order to improve and maintain the "SchoolVerse" service. "SchoolVerse" will have web views through
            the web application currently in development. <br> <br>

            However, "VerseGroup" and "SchoolVerse" are not liable for your data, and you use our software at your own risk. 
            We reserve the right to modify or amend this policy at any time; especially as the "SchoolVerse" and "VerseGroup" team continues to add new policies in order to ensure the future security and privacy of your data. 
            Further, "VerseGroup" and "SchoolVerse" will not sell your data. 

            If you would like to view or delete your data, or have any questions, please contact a member of the "VerseGroup" team.  <br>
